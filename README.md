# 🕹️ Hi there, my name is Ritvik Gupta. 
### I'm a student and software developer from New Jersey. Check out some of my repositories. I code mainly in Python and Javascript.

I was introduced to programming at a young age with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).
After learning to fundamentals of coding, I moved on to [Python](https://www.python.org/), my first written language.
I quickly fell in love with the language, developing small projects and completing coding challenges.
