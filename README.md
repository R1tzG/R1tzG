# üïπÔ∏è Hi there!
### My name is Ritvik Gupta. I'm a student and software developer from New Jersey. Check out some of my repositories. I code mainly in Python and Javascript.

I was introduced to programming at a young age with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).
After learning the fundamentals of coding, I moved on to [Python](https://www.python.org/), my first written language.
I quickly fell in love with the language, developing small projects and completing coding challenges.
My first introduction to front end development was web design with [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).
I wanted to add more functionality to my websites, so I started learning [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/).
With my proficient knowledge in Python and Javascript, I am learning about combining my knowledge to make full-stack applications.

Outside of my personal coding endeavours, I am part of Millburn Robotics AI, which is the first ever VEX AI team. Here is the github repo for our codebase: https://github.com/22pilarskil/VEXAI_2021-2022
