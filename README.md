# üïπÔ∏è Hi there!
### My name is Ritvik Gupta. I'm a student and software developer from New Jersey. Check out some of my repositories. I code mainly in Python and Java.

I was introduced to programming at a young age with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).
After learning the fundamentals of coding, I moved on to [Python](https://www.python.org/), my first written language.
I quickly fell in love with the language, developing small projects and completing coding challenges.
My first introduction to front end development was web design with [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).
I wanted to add more functionality to my websites, so I started learning [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/). One of my main fields of interest is machine learning, specifically generating synthetic data with adversarial neural networks. I am fascinated by the idea of generating synthetic data that is almost indistinguishable from real data.

Outside of my personal coding endeavours, I am part of Millburn Robotics AI, a pioneer of artificial intelligence in the VEX robotics competition. Here is the github repo for our codebase: https://github.com/22pilarskil/VEXAI_2021-2022. Also check out the website I made to showcase our work: https://millburnai.org.

Skills:
- Languages: Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, C#, C++
- Tools: Unity, Blender
- Libraries: Tensorflow, Three.js, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Pandas
